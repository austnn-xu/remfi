**Methodology**

REMFI studies mechanical failure using a consistent, repeatable workflow based on core ideas from **FMEA** and **reliability engineering**.

**Failure classification**

Each case is labeled by the main mechanical failure mechanism:

- **fatigue** (rolling contact, bending, torsion)
- **lubrication breakdown** (starvation, contamination, viscosity mismatch)
- **vibration and resonance**
- **misalignment and assembly error**
- **manufacturing or material defects**
- **maintenance-induced failure**

**System boundary**

REMFI focuses on **mechanical hardware**. Electrical or software issues are included only when they **directly trigger or accelerate mechanical damage**.

**Root cause vs contributing factors**

Every case separates:

- **root cause:** the physical mechanism that initiates the failure
- **contributing factors:** operating conditions, environment, or human actions that speed up the damage

**Source standards**

Cases rely on sources such as:

- **peer-reviewed journals**
- **national lab reports** (for example, **NREL**)
- **OEM technical bulletins**
- **industry reliability studies**

Marketing content, speculation, and uncited claims are **not used**.

**Update cadence**

REMFI aims to publish **about one new case per month** and updates older cases when **better data or clearer explanations** become available.
