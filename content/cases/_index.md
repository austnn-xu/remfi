### Mechanical Failure Case Files

---

Each REMFI case study examines a real-world mechanical failure in an energy system, focusing on the underlying physical mechanisms rather than surface-level outcomes.

The analyses emphasize repeatability, clear assumptions, and engineering reasoning.

### Case 01: Thermal Cycling–Induced Fatigue in Brazed Aluminum Heat Exchangers

This case examines how repeated thermal expansion and contraction in brazed aluminum heat exchangers can lead to fatigue cracking and eventual loss of containment.

Key focus areas include stress concentration at brazed joints, material mismatch, and the cumulative effects of startup–shutdown cycles.

### Case 02: Wind Turbine Gearbox Bearing Failure

This case examines premature bearing failure in wind turbine gearboxes driven by micro pitting under variable loading and degraded lubrication conditions.

The analysis focuses on surface fatigue initiation, damage progression, and the role of lubrication breakdown in accelerating wear and failure in renewable energy systems.
