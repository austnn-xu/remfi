### Mechanical Failure Case Files

---

Each REMFI case study examines a real-world mechanical failure in an energy system, focusing on the underlying physical mechanisms rather than surface-level outcomes.

The analyses emphasize repeatability, clear assumptions, and engineering reasoning.

### Case 01: Thermal Cycling–Induced Fatigue in Brazed Aluminum Heat Exchangers

This case examines how repeated thermal expansion and contraction in brazed aluminum heat exchangers can lead to fatigue cracking and eventual loss of containment.

Key focus areas include stress concentration at brazed joints, material mismatch, and the cumulative effects of startup–shutdown cycles.
