REMFI was founded by Austin Xu, an engineering student with a strong interest in mechanical engineering, robotics, and failure analysis.

My interest in engineering comes from building, testing, and debugging systems where small design decisions can have large real-world consequences. Through robotics competitions and independent study, I became increasingly interested in what happens *when engineering systems fail*, and how those failures can be analyzed systematically.

REMFI is an independent project developed to explore real mechanical failures in energy-related systems using an engineering mindset. The goal is not to assign blame, but to understand failure mechanisms, extract lessons, and improve future designs.

This project reflects my long-term academic interest in mechanical engineering and energy systems, and my desire to approach engineering problems with rigor, curiosity, and humility.
