<p class="home-lead">
REMFI is an independent engineering research project analyzing real-world mechanical failures in energy systems using reliability and failure-analysis principles.
</p>

<h2>What this project does</h2>

<p>
REMFI examines documented mechanical failures to identify dominant failure mechanisms, contributing factors, and transferable engineering lessons. Each case emphasizes how and why components fail, supported by credible technical sources.
