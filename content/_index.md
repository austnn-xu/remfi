REMFI (Renewable Energy Mechanical Failure Index) is an open, public engineering archive documenting mechanical failure modes in renewable energy systems, with an initial focus on utility-scale wind turbines.

The project analyzes *why* mechanical systems fail in the real world — not just how they are designed — emphasizing fatigue, lubrication breakdown, vibration, misalignment, manufacturing defects, and maintenance-induced errors.

REMFI publishes monthly, cited case studies with accompanying audio explainers and transcripts to make complex mechanical failures accessible without sacrificing technical rigor.

### Scope
- Wind turbine gearboxes and main bearings (initial focus)
- Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA-inspired)
- Root cause vs contributing factors
- Industry + peer-reviewed sources only

### Start Here
- **Cases**: Monthly mechanical failure case studies  
- **Methodology**: How failures are classified and analyzed  
- **Sources**: Master bibliography and core references  
- **About**: Project background and intent
