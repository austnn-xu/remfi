REMFI (Renewable Energy Mechanical Failure Index) is an open, public archive that documents and analyzes mechanical failure modes in renewable energy hardware, starting with utility-scale wind turbine gearboxes and main bearings.



What REMFI does

\- publishes monthly, cited case studies (Case 001, Case 002, …)

\- classifies failures by mechanism (fatigue, lubrication breakdown, vibration/resonance, misalignment, manufacturing defects)

\- separates root cause vs contributing factors

\- adds an audio explainer + transcript for each case



What REMFI is not

\- not marketing or hype

\- not a news feed

\- not speculation without sources



Start here

\- Methodology: how failures are classified and scored

\- Cases: the case index (updated monthly)

\- Sources: master bibliography and core references
