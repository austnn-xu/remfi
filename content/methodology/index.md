REMFI analyzes mechanical failures in energy systems by focusing on *how* and *why* components fail, rather than on policy or speculation.

Each case study follows a consistent engineering-oriented process designed to mirror how failures are analyzed in industry and academic research.

### Scope of Analysis
REMFI focuses primarily on mechanical systems and components, including structures, rotating machinery, heat exchangers, and joints. Electrical or software systems are considered only when they directly contribute to mechanical damage or failure.

### Failure Identification
Each case begins by identifying the failed component and the operational context in which the failure occurred. This includes loading conditions, temperature cycles, environmental exposure, and duty cycles when available.

### Failure Mechanism Analysis
Failures are categorized based on dominant mechanisms such as fatigue, thermal cycling, corrosion, wear, vibration-induced damage, or manufacturing defects. The goal is to identify the root physical process responsible for the failure, not just the visible damage.

### Evidence and Sources
Conclusions are supported using publicly available technical reports, peer-reviewed journal articles, industry case studies, and government investigations. Marketing material or unsupported claims are intentionally excluded.

### Limitations
REMFI does not claim absolute certainty in its conclusions. Many real-world failures involve incomplete data. Where assumptions are made, they are stated clearly, and alternative explanations are acknowledged when appropriate.
