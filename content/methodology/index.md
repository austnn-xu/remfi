REMFI analyzes mechanical failures using a structured, repeatable framework inspired by Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and reliability engineering practices.



\## Failure Classification

Each case is categorized by its dominant mechanical failure mechanism:

\- Fatigue (rolling contact, bending, torsional)

\- Lubrication breakdown (starvation, contamination, viscosity mismatch)

\- Vibration and resonance

\- Misalignment and assembly error

\- Manufacturing or materials defects

\- Maintenance-induced failure



\## System Boundary

REMFI focuses on mechanical hardware rather than electrical or software faults, except where those faults directly contribute to mechanical damage.



\## Root Cause vs Contributing Factors

Each case explicitly separates:

\- Root cause: the primary physical mechanism that initiated failure

\- Contributing factors: environmental, operational, or human factors that accelerated damage



\## Source Standards

Accepted sources include:

\- Peer-reviewed academic journals

\- National laboratory reports (e.g., NREL)

\- OEM technical bulletins

\- Industry reliability studies



Marketing material, speculation, and uncited claims are excluded.



\## Update Cadence

REMFI publishes approximately one new case per month and revises prior cases as new information becomes available.
